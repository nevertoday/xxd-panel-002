> NARRATIVE CONTOUR · HESITANT LINE · ANALOGOUS COLOUR · SELECTIVE ENLARGEMENT · MISREGISTERED TYPE

XXD Panel 002 is an image-generation Skill for Codex and compatible agents. It accurately preserves identity, visible emotion, pose, and spatial relation, then translates them through hesitant contour, one selectively enlarged narrative feature, loose wash, and old-print misregistration into a page poised between a carefully kept vintage fashion picture book and a modern art magazine.

The result does not trace the photograph's surface. It finds one intelligent, playful, source-bound transformation and combines modernist editorial drawing, Bauhaus order, picture-book warmth, and the ease of a fashion sketch. Type feels like a restrained note left by the illustrator, not an advertising headline pasted on later.

## Why it exists

“Hand-drawn style” easily collapses into generic cute cartooning: perfectly smooth outlines, an interchangeable palette, or a digital noise filter pretending to be paper and pigment.

002 reverses that logic:

```text
lock source facts → find one source-specific visual metaphor → simplify with relaxed imperfect line → layer watercolour, gouache, pencil, and pastel → preserve warm-paper breathing room → add restrained retro lettering
```

If an unrelated photograph could replace the source without materially changing the subject, metaphor, gesture, palette, or copy, the result is not 002.

## The 002 visual contract

- **Recognisable narrative silhouette:** retain at least three source-specific identity cues, pose, and spatial relation. The contour may hesitate but cannot lose identity.
- **Source-specific transformation:** derive one intelligent, natural visual metaphor from an action, structure, setting, or mood instead of applying a fixed visual trick.
- **Selective feature enlargement:** enlarge only one detail that genuinely carries identity, visible emotion, or story; never distort arbitrarily.
- **Hesitant hand contour:** keep line thin and relaxed, with pressure shifts, broken marks, and open joins—never smooth vector outlines.
- **Light mixed-media depth:** combine transparent watercolour blooms, matte gouache, coloured-pencil hatching, pastel or crayon grain, and dry brush without becoming heavy.
- **Analogous colour unity:** organise high-value, low-to-medium saturation neighbouring hues from the source, with one small complementary jump.
- **Loose support and old print:** pale washes, local diagonals, or simple geometry serve action and space; show broken marks, dirty-colour deposits, show-through, and registration drift.
- **Type grown into the picture:** use naive-retro hand lettering with gentle serif or sans-serif support; controlled offset, tilt, stretch, colour overlap, or misregistration may integrate it.

These samples demonstrate the 002 aesthetic motive. Their subjects, composition, palette, copy, and earlier canvas ratio never become generation references or current defaults.

## Four combinable output modes

Choose one or several modes with `1`, `1+3`, `1,2,4`, or `all`; `all` produces seven separate PNGs per source. After mode selection and before generation, the Skill explicitly asks for the whole finished canvas: the original-prompt `3:4`, an explicit source-aspect choice, a common ratio, or custom ratio/exact pixels. Source dimensions are never applied silently.

| Mode | Canvas rule | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `top-bottom` | user-confirmed whole canvas | one complete generation: high-fidelity source above, 002 design below, approximately 50/50 |
| `left-right` | user-confirmed whole canvas | one complete generation: high-fidelity source left, 002 design right, approximately 50/50 |
| `design-only` | user-confirmed whole canvas | 002 design fills the canvas; source remains invisible |
| `wallpaper-pack` | confirmed per device | separate phone, iPad, desktop, and children's-watch PNGs |

Paired modes use the source as a high-fidelity edit/reference input and one complete style prompt to generate the finished composition directly, so photography, design, colour, light, typography, and meaning can cohere. Deterministic composition is fallback-only: after one targeted complete-canvas retry fails, when pixel-identical source preservation is explicitly required, when the active route cannot realise the canvas, or for lossless final pixel calibration.

Wallpapers may be linked or independent. A linked pack approves one iPad anchor, then recomposes every other device from the original plus that same anchor. An independent pack gives each device only the original. Neither crops another device output nor chains derivatives.

## Copy must grow from the picture

Before generation, choose automatic copy, custom copy, or text-free output. Name the target language or locale whenever copy is present.

Automatic copy distils one short title from subject identity, known place, visible atmosphere, or a symbol supported by the photograph. It may be warm and poetic, but does not force a pun, reversal, or standardised “moment of recognition”.

The default is one title. Add zero to two short annotations only when they carry real information; never invent catalogue numbers, years, coordinates, or archival labels merely to look sophisticated. Copy must still pass the unrelated-image swap test.

Finished user wording stays verbatim. A direction or editable draft is refined only while preserving audience, purpose, mandatory words, tone, and implication.

Language follows the intended audience rather than the command language:

```text
target market or audience > requested output language > direction language; if none is explicit, ask before generation
```

A Japanese edition uses natural Japanese, a Korean-audience edition uses natural Korean and correct spacing, a UK edition uses British English, and Arabic defaults to natural Modern Standard Arabic with genuine right-to-left composition. The Skill never guesses nationality from appearance, clothing, scenery, or signs and never uses pseudo-foreign text.

## Complete-canvas first, raster-only delivery

The image model owns the aesthetics of the entire finished composition; paired layouts also default to one complete-canvas generation. `scripts/compose_panel.py` remains only for condition-based recovery, lossless pixel calibration, and read-only audit. It is not run pre-emptively and does not judge aesthetic success.

Every deliverable is a raster PNG and every invocation creates a fresh task under `~/Desktop/xxd/`. The configured image route exposes sanitised status only—never providers, endpoints, credentials, headers, prompts, responses, or account details. SVG, HTML, Canvas, diagrams, and programmatic drawing are not substitutes for the final artwork.

## Image-model priority

GPT Image 2 is the default first choice. It keeps this project's established workflow: high-fidelity source reference, explicit whole-canvas selection before generation, one complete-canvas generation for paired modes, and scripted composition only as a conditional fallback.

Seedance 5.0 Pro, Nano Banana Pro (Gemini Image Pro), Nano Banana 2 (Gemini Image Flash), or another compatible bitmap model may also be used when it is actually available through the current tools or configured routes and can satisfy source fidelity, whole-canvas ratio, target-language text, and linked-wallpaper multi-reference requirements. An alternative changes only the generation route; it must not change modes, canvas, copy, locale, wallpaper relationship, or the complete-canvas-first strategy.

If no suitable route is available, the Skill asks the user to enable an image-generation tool or provide an API key. User-provided credentials may be used for the current task without being echoed, displayed, logged, or exposed. They are not persisted, and provider, account, billing, or global route configuration is not modified, unless the user explicitly requests that configuration change.

## Get started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nevertoday/xxd-panel-002.git
mkdir -p ~/.codex/skills
ln -s "$(pwd)/xxd-panel-002" ~/.codex/skills/xxd-panel-002
```

Claude Code users may link the same directory to `~/.claude/skills/xxd-panel-002`. Restart the agent session after installation.

```text
$xxd-panel-002
Turn this photograph into a left-right composition. Derive the copy from the image and write it in natural Korean.
```

You may invoke the Skill with only a photograph. It first asks for one or more modes in a numbered multiline menu, then for copy settings; wallpaper mode also asks for linked/independent continuity and device sizes.

## Boundaries and trust

- Each photograph stays within its own task and never borrows subjects, colours, copy, or composition from other inputs, old results, or samples.
- Every invocation creates a fresh task directory; even identical sources and parameters must generate anew.
- Deliverables are PNG bitmaps, never SVG, HTML, Canvas, or programmatic-drawing substitutes.
- The configured bitmap bridge emits sanitised status only and does not expose providers, endpoints, headers, credentials, prompts, or response bodies.
- Each selected ordinary mode returns one file; selected `wallpaper-pack` adds four separate wallpapers. `all` returns seven PNGs per source across four sibling mode directories, never a contact sheet or overview.

Local composition needs Python 3 and Pillow. The safe bitmap bridge uses Python 3.11+ `tomllib`. Image generation still requires a host agent with built-in raster generation or an already configured compatible raster route.
